  - A user in the web application can edit the values in each cell
* The person is able to connect the React application to Notion
* When the person edits a field in the web app, after the WebApp-NotionPlugin connection is made, the Notion table (or database) is updated in real time
* When the person edits a field in Notion, the web app is updated in real time 
* When a person clicks a buton to add the number of rows or columns in the React application, the number of rows and columns in the notion table is updated in real time
